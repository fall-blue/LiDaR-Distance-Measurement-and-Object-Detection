# LiDAR Object Detection and Distance Measurement
The project focuses on creating an indoor navigation device
for individuals with visual impairments. Combining YOLOv8
object detection, a TF-Luna LiDAR sensor, and a Raspberry
Pi 4, the system recognizes and measures the distance to
indoor objects within a 1.5 to 3-meter range. Utilizing Google
Text-to-Speech, the collected data is converted into spoken
messages for real-time auditory feedback through an
earpiece. The device emphasizes accessibility with voice
commands and tactile controls, offering an integrated
solution for safer and more independent navigation in indoor
environments.
